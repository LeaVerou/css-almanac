# Web Almanac CSS Chapter 2020

Repo for planning &amp; voting on which stats to study

Please [vote](https://leaverou.github.io/mavoice/?repo=leaverou/css-almanac&labels=proposed%20stat) on the [proposed stats](https://github.com/LeaVerou/css-almanac/labels/proposed%20stat) you would like to see explored with a üëç or [use MaVoice for one click voting](https://leaverou.github.io/mavoice/?repo=leaverou/css-almanac&labels=proposed%20stat).

* Please try to restrict your votes to your favorite metrics and don‚Äôt vote on every single proposal. Roughly, avoid voting for more than 7-8 proposals. It's ok to remove your vote from one proposal to vote for another one.
* Please note that votes are non-binding, we may still decide to calculate a stat that has few votes. 
* Please note that these proposals have not yet been evaluated for feasibility. Not every statistic can be studied with the HTTPArchive corpus. It is possible that a proposal may have many votes, but turn out to be infeasible in its proposed form.
